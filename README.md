## Hey there! 👋

I'm Ignacy — a passionate geek who left the corporate galaxy to explore the Open Source universe. Currently leading engineering at [Farmgirl Flowers](https://www.farmgirlflowers.com/) 🌸

### What I love working on

- **Infrastructure**: High-scale systems, operating systems, cluster file systems
- **Languages**: Ruby (constantly improving my Ruby Fu!), Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash
- **Low-level stuff**: Assembler quirks, debugging complex systems
- **DevOps**: Linux administration, application clusters, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

### A bit about me

I studied Control Engineering at Gdańsk University of Technology and spent time in semiconductors before diving into full-stack development and infrastructure. I'm all about neat solutions whether they're for massive infrastructures or tiny system-level optimizations.
